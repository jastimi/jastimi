## Hi there 👋 I’m Mohan Sai

💡 Data Engineer | Cloud & Big Data Enthusiast | Builder of Scalable Data Systems

I’m passionate about turning raw data into reliable insights.
With hands-on experience across Azure, AWS, and Big Data platforms, I love solving complex data problems — from real-time pipelines to analytics-ready data models that power decisions.


Outside of data, I enjoy exploring AI-driven solutions, mentoring peers, and experimenting with side projects that mix data, cloud, and automation.
